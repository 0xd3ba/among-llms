## Introduction
Among LLMs turns your **terminal** into a chaotic chatroom playground where you’re the only human among a bunch of
eccentric AI agents, dropped into a common *scenario* -- it could be Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Crime, or something 
completely unexpected. Each participant, including you, has a *persona* and a *backstory*, and all the AI agents
share one common goal -- determine and eliminate the human, through *voting*. 
Your mission: stay hidden, manipulate conversations, and turn the bots against each other with edits, whispers, impersonations, and clever gaslighting.
Outlast everyone, turn chaos to your advantage, and make it to the final two. 

Can you survive the hunt and *outsmart* the AI?
